This project comes as an example of real-life application of TCP and UDP. The communication between client and server is based primarly on TCP sockets, UPD sockets being used when a card is blocked and someone is trying to unlock it. 

More information can be found in Enunt.pdf and info file (they are both in Romanian).

Compile: make.
Run: make run_server / run_client.
